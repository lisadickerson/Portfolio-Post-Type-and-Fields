This plugin creates a custom post type for portfolio items with custom display fields.


== Description ==

This plugin creates a custom post type for portfolio items with custom display fields. You will need to edit your theme to display the custom fields. This plugin was created to maintain a portfolio custom post type that could be utilized by other plugin like for example the: Go Portfolio - WordPress Plugin. It creates a new interface to manage your portfolio posts separate from blog posts and web pages.


== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.


== Customization

The custom fields were created with ACF and imported into the plugin.
Some features are dependent on ACF Pro modules like the gallery field.
You will need to purchase the Pro version and install it for the gallery field to work.

== Frequently Asked Questions

= Why did you make this plugin?


I started this plugin as a custom functions plugin for my site only, to reduce my dependency on themes or plugins to maintain my portfolio.
It is also a way for me to dive deeper into my understanding of custom post types and their arguments and plugins development by **and learn by doing**.


= Are all the bugs worked out?
**No** all the bug are not worked out. I created the post type to use the site wide categories and tags. It doesn&#39;t quite work like I expected it too. I also need to re-write the slug to pull a more SEO friendly title.
= Are there other plugins that create a portfolio post type?
