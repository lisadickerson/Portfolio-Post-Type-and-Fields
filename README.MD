## Frequently Asked Questions


 


### Why did you make this plugin?


I started this plugin as a custom functions plugin for my site only, to reduce my dependency on themes or plugins to maintain my portfolio.
It is also a way for me to dive deeper into my understanding of custom post types and their arguments and plugins development by __and learn by doing__.


### Are all the bugs worked out?
__No__ all the bug are not worked out. I created the post type to use the site wide categories and tags. It doesn&#39;t quite work like I expected it too. I also need to re-write the slug to pull a more SEO friendly title.
### Are there other plugins that create a portfolio post type?


Yes take a look at two great professional plugins :smile_cat:
